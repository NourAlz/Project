# Web Project

For my web development course, we were asked to do a project to showcase the skills we learned throughout the semester. I decided on something simple to use my basic skills in developing a simple website, starting with a home page, having a navigation bar and a simple body. And a blog page, having various elements. The peak of the project is my room page, were my javascript skills were convied to create different functionalities. 

Despite the simplicity of the project, it was still a challenge for me as a first web project. Although it took time, I learned a lot, and I am glad I got to test my skills for the very first time in something I enjoy doing. 

More projects incoming in the future, and definetly coming with stronger skills to show my progress.
